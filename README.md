## Branching strategy

- `main` branch : production branch, create a pull request for adding something on it
- `develop` branch : development branch, code before the pull-request to the `main` branch
- `develop/:your_feature` branch : create a branch with the feature you want to create, and after create a pull request to the `develop` branch

## Run in development mode

For running one module in development mode use : ```./run-dev.sh```
